        <h1>10 Years of UFO Sightings, 2005-2014</h1>
        <p>
            Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), have captured the imaginations of people worldwide. UFOs are, like their name suggests, objects in the sky that are unidentifiable.
            They are usually reported to appear at night, in a variety of shapes. UFOs are linked to extraterrestrial conspiracies, such as the existence of life outside of Earth.
            In 2023, recent news reported that the Government of the United States allegedly captured a UFO, and the aliens operating it. 
            <br>
            With the recent rise in interest regarding extraterrestrial activity, this dashboard analyzes global UFO sighting data over the last 10 years.

        <h2>Where are UFOs sighted?</h2>
        <p>
            UFOs have been sighted all over the globe. The map below shows the countries with mentions of UFOs, normalised by population. Interestingly, 4 of the 7 continents (Asia, Africa, South America, Antarctica) have
            no reported UFO sightings between the years 2005 and 2014. The countries with any UFO mentions are in the North American, European, and Australian continents.
            The United States has by far the most UFO sightings reported. Canada is a close second, followed by Great Britain, Germany, and Australia, in no particular order.

        <h2>Yearly UFO Sighting Trends</h2>
        <p>
            The line chart below shows the trend of UFO sightings over the last 10 years. We can see that generally, the number of UFO Sightings increases as the years progress. Interestingly, we see a number of spikes in UFO reports.  
            The United States consistently has the most UFO sightings. 
            Another interesting point is that the number of UFO sightings reported tends to spike during the 4th of July. The alien emojis on the line chart correspond to the 4th of July, which is the United States' Independence Day.

        <h2>Most Common UFO Shapes</h2>
        <p>
            UFOs are reported to come in all shapes and sizes. UFOs are also colloquially known as flying saucers, oval or circular-shaped aircraft with shining lights.
            In more modern times, UFOs are most commonly sighted as balls of light, with no discernable shape or size.

            Use the sliding bar to filter out less commonly seen shapes.

        <h2>Most Referenced Animals during UFO Sighting Reports</h2>
        <p>
            A classic UFO folk tale involves a large flying saucer abducting a cow from a field. Saucer-shaped aircraft would float over a field, and a cow would float into the UFO.
            In more modern times, however, cows seem to be mentioned less, with more mentions of other domestic animals, such as Dogs,
            with over 120 unique mentions. Birds are the next most mentioned animal, with around 40.
            The iconic cow is only mentioned 5 times over the last 10 years of UFO sightings.
