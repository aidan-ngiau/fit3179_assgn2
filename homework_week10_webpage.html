    <h1>UFO Data Dashboard</h1>
    <p>
        Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), have captured the imaginations of people worldwide. 
        <br>
        In this dashboard, we will analyse UFO sighting data over the last 10 years.
        <br>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Worldwide UFO Sightings</h2>
    <p>
        In the map below, we see that the United States of America has by far the most UFO sightings. 
        <br>
        Other countries with UFO sightings include the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.

    <h2>Yearly UFO Sighting Trends</h2>
    <p>
        The line chart below shoes the trend of UFO sightings over the last 10 years. 
        <br>
        We can see that generally, the number of UFO Sightings increases
        <br>
        as the years progress. Interestingly, we see a number of spikes in UFO reports.  
        <br>
        The alien emojis on the line chart correspond to the 4th of July, which is the United States' Independence Day.
        <br>
        The number of UFO sightings tend to spike during the 4th of July.
        <br>
        This may be caused by excessive use of fireworks, leading people to see flashing lights in the sky.
        <br>
        Alternatively, excessive consumption of alcohol on the 4th of July may impair judgement. 
        <br>
        Intoxicated people may be misinterpreting airplanes or lasers in the sky as UFO sightings, explaining the report spikes 
        <br>
        during the 4th of July.

    <h2>Most Referenced Animals during UFO Sighting Reports</h2>
    <p>
        A classic UFO folk tale involves a large flying saucer abducting a cow from a field.
        <br>
        Looking at the data, however, shows that dogs are the most mentioned animal during UFO sightings,
        <br>
        with over 120 unique mentions. Birds are the next most mentioned animal, with around 40.
        <br>
        The iconic cow is only mentioned 5 times over the last 10 years of UFO sightings.
