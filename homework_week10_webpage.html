        We can see that between the years 2005 - 2010, there were around 4000 UFO sightings reported worldwide.
        <br>
        The number of UFO sightings then spiked between the years 2011 - 2013,

        A classic UFO folk tale involves a large flying saucer abducting a cow from a field.
        <br>
        Looking at the data, however, shows that dogs are the most mentioned animal during UFO sightings,
        <br>
        with over 120 unique mentions. Birds are the next most mentioned animal, with around 40.
        <br>
        The iconic cow is only mentioned 5 times over the last 10 years of UFO sightings.
